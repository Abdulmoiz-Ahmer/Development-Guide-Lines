**Letter Case Definitions**

**camelCase**
Must start with a lowercase letter with the first letter of every subsequent word capitalized with all whitespace removed. For example, a camel cased variable containing **Agent** data might be `agentData`.

**snake_case**
Replaces all spaces with an underscore `(_)` and lowercases all words. For example, a camel cased variable containing **Agent** data might be `agent_data`.

**kebab-case**
Similar to snake casing, kebab casing replaces all spaces with a hyphen `(-)` and lowercases all words. For example, a kebab cased variable containing **Agent** data might be `agent-data`.

**PascalCase**
Similar to camel casing, pascal casing removes all whitespaces and capitalized the first letter of each word, however pascal case uppercases the first word as well as all subsequent words. For example, a pascal cased variable containing **Agent** data might be `AgentData`.
